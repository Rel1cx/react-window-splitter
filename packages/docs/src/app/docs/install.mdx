## Server Side Rendering + Strict Mode

While not required for the simple case, for anything more complex you will
need to add an `id` prop to your panels and handles.
This is so that the component can tell all of the components apart during layout and rendering.\_createMdxContent

Features that require `id`:

- Conditional Panels
- Server Side Rendering
- React Strict Mode
